# ML ARQ ! 

This is a fun application built with the only purpose of learning how [Docker](https://www.docker.com) works and also learning to create a basic ML ARQ. The app is built with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) on the backend.


### Running the app

There are two different ways of getting the app up and running:

####  Docker Compose
```
$ docker-compose up
```

####  Mannualy
If you choose this way, you must change the database host to "localhost" or the one that fit to your purposes, since it is setted up to run using Docker engine.
